 * This file contains the SVH controler, the heart of the driver.
 * It is responsible to manage all logical decissions regarding the hardware
 * on a low level. It knows what packet index is used for which function
 * and holds all the data objects that can be queried externally.
 * The controller should not be queried by outside calls directly as it asumes
 * the calls to be non maleformed or contain out of bounds acces as this is handled
 * by the finger manager. Also note that the calls on this level should be made
 * channel wise. The iteration of channels is done in the finger controller.
 *
 * Request and Get principle: As the communication with the hand had some issues with the bandwith
 * there are two types of function calls. The request functions tell the driver to actually request the data
 * from the hardware. The get functions just get the last received value from the controller without actually
 * querrying the hardware. This might be changed in further releases.
