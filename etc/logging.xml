<!-- Configuration of log output. The logging mechanism uses
so-called LogStreams, which carry messages for specific topics
(see the LogStream1, ..., LogStream4 at the end of this file),
and for which a LogLevel can be set. The LogStreams are then
gathered by OutputStreams, which can write the log data to
standard output or standard error, or (as is configured below)
into a file. A LogLevel can be set for the OutputStreams as
well, if you want to limit the flood of log messages gathered
from various LogStreams. -->
